# Removing Data

In addition to the *insertion events,* the `DataGridCollectionView` and `DataGridCollectionViewSource` classes also expose the `RemovingItem` and `ItemRemoved` events, which are raised when the Remove or RemoveAt methods have been called to signal that an item is about to be removed or has been removed, respectively, from the underlying data source.

If the process is manually handled, the **Handled** property received in the event parameters of the `RemovingItem` event must be set to true. The removal process can also be canceled by setting the `Cancel` property to true.
