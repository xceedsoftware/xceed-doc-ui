# Inserting Data

The `DataGridCollectionView` and `DataGridCollectionViewSource` classes expose events (see Table 1) that are triggered during key stages of inserting a new item into an underlying data source. These events provide full control over the insertion process and make it possible to insert items into a source that does not implement the `IBindingList` interface.

Table 1: Insertion events

| Event | 	Description   |
|-------|-----------------|
| `CreatingNewItem`	| Raised when the `AddNew` method has been called to signal that a new item is about to be created. |
| `InitializingNewItem`	| Raised after the `CreatingNewItem` event to allow the new item to be initialized. |
| `NewItemCreated`	| Raised after the `CreatingNewItem` and `InitializingNewItem` events to signal that a new item has been created. |
| `CommittingNewItem`	| Raised when the `CommitNew` method has been called to signal that a new item is about to be committed to the underlying data source. |
| `NewItemCommitted`	| Raised after the `CommittingNewItem` event to signal that a new item has been committed to the underlying data source. |
| `CancelingNewItem`	| Raised when the `CancelNew` method has been called to signal that the insertion process of a new item is about to be canceled. |
| `NewItemCanceled`	| Raised after the `CancelingNewItem` event to signal that the insertion process of a new item has been canceled. |

The `CreatingNewItem` and `InitializingNewItem` events are raised sequentially by the AddNew method to signal that a new item is about to be created and may need to be initialized. In the `CreatingNewItem` event, if the insertion of new items is to be handled manually, a new item must be provided and the **Handled** property set to true to indicate that the process will be handled manually. If a new item is provided but the **Handled** property was not set or was set to false, the item will be ignored and an attempt will be made by the DataGridCollectionView to create a new item.

If a new item is provided in the `CreatingNewItem` event, its values can be initialized either there or in the `InitializingNewItem` event. If the item was automatically created by the DataGridCollectionView, its values can only be initialized in the `InitializingNewItem` event.

:::caution
An **InvalidOperationException** will be thrown if the **Handled** property is set to true but a new item is not provided.
:::

Once the item has been created and initialized, the **NewItemCreated** event will be raised to signal that the new item has been created. If the creation of the new item is canceled (e.g., the **ESC** key is pressed or **CancelNew** is called), the CancelingNewItem event will be raised followed by the **NewItemCanceled** event. 

When manually handling the item-insertion process, the **ComittingNewItem** will be raised by the CommitNew method to signal that the new item is about to be committed to the underlying data source. In this event—not the **CreatingNewItem** event—the new item can be added to the underlying data source using custom-defined logic. Once the new item is successfully committed to the underlying data source, the Index and NewCount properties received as event parameters must be set to the required values. Regardless, the **Handled** property must be set to true to indicate that the process was handled (see Example 1).

:::caution
Manually **handling** the insertion of new items requires that the `CreatingNewItem`, `CommitingNewItem`, and `CancelingNewItem` events must all be handled; otherwise, an **InvalidOperationException** will be throw
:::

## Examples
All examples in this topic assume that the grid is bound to the Orders table of the Northwind database or a collection of Person objects, unless stated otherwise.

Example 1: Manually handling the insertion process

The following example demonstrates how to manually handle the insertion process of a new item into a collection.
